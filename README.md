### The Challenge

Users should be able to:

- Create, read, update, and delete blog posts
- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

### Links

- Live Site URL: [Add live site URL here](#)

### My Process

#### Built With

- Go (Golang) for the backend
- Gin web framework
- SQLite for the database
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox for layout
- Mobile-first workflow

#### What I Learned

This project deepened my understanding of web application development with Go and the Gin framework. I gained valuable experience in setting up RESTful APIs, managing database interactions with GORM, and implementing responsive design principles.

#### Continued Development

In future projects, I aim to focus on:

- Enhancing the authentication and authorization features
- Implementing advanced querying and indexing techniques in SQLite
- Expanding the frontend with more interactive features and improved UX

#### Useful Resources

- [Go Documentation](https://golang.org/doc/) - Comprehensive guide to the Go programming language.
- [Gin Documentation](https://gin-gonic.com/docs/) - Detailed documentation for the Gin web framework.
- [GORM Documentation](https://gorm.io/docs/) - Helpful for understanding database interactions using GORM.
